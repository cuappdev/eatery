Thanks for using Eatery from Cornell AppDev!

Look, we hear ya. Your app may be crashing a lot if something went wrong with your BRB login. So, this time around, we're gonna try to fix those.

In this update, we've:
- Added robust crash reporting, so if your apps crash we will see exactly why
- Added a bit of animation
- Fixed an issue where unlimited meal plans are shown to have "0" swipes
- Added missing locations to eateries
